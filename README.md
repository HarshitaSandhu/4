# Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews
Sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews is the process of analyzing written reviews to determine the opinions and attitudes expressed about the products shopped online. The aim is to automatically classify the sentiment of the review as positive, negative. The steps involved in sentiment analysis on product reviews include data collection, data preprocessing, sentiment classification, evaluation, and visualization. Data is collected from various sources, such as online review websites. The collected data is then cleaned and prepared for analysis by removing irrelevant information and standardizing the text. Sentiment classification is performed using NLP techniques, which can include rule-based systems, machine learning algorithms, or deep learning models. The accuracy of the sentiment analysis model is evaluated by comparing its predictions to labeled data or human judgments. Finally, the results of the sentiment analysis are visualized to provide insights into the restaurant's reputation and customer satisfaction.
